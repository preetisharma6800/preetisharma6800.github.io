launch</a><br>The orbiter will orbit the Moon and collect data about the Moon’s atmosphere, surface, 
and interior.<br>The main goal of Chandrayaan 3 is to search for water ice on the Moon.
 Water ice is a valuable resource for future human exploration of the Moon. It can be
 used for drinking, growing food.<br>The successful landing of Chandrayaan-3 is a major
 achievement for India’s space program. It is only the fourth country to successfully
 land a spacecraft on the Moon, and the first to land on the south pole. This 
accomplishment is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the <b>ISRO team.</b>
